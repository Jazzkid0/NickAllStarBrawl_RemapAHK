# NickAllStarBrawl_RemapAHK
A simple AHK file to remap the keyboard input for Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl

Edit the key written on the left of the two semicolons (::) in order to change what the input is remapped to.

Notes:

The C-Stick style inputs are only strong attacks for now, it's better than nothing I guess
I'd like to have an alternate script with a modifier that determines whether any attack is light or heavy and just use one attack button+c-stick, but that sounds difficult for me haha.

Still figuring out how to create a macro to suspend the script, feel free to send me a solution and I'll put it here.
