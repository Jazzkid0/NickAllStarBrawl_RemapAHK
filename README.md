# NickAllStarBrawl_RemapAHK
A simple file to remap the keyboard input for Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl

There's also a hand-swapped .exe version for people who just want to use WSAD and Box style controls. It's got movement on WSAD and the standard layout (qwe/asd) put on the right hand as (uio/jkl)

Usage:

Run the script to swap your keys
Close the script in the taskbar or task manager to make your keys normal again

Edit the key written on the left of the two semicolons (::) in order to change what the input is remapped to, and remember to save your ahk file before running again.

Notes:

The C-Stick style inputs are only strong attacks for now, it's better than nothing I guess
I'd like to have an alternate script with a modifier that determines whether any attack is light or heavy and just use one attack button+c-stick, but that sounds difficult for me haha.

Still figuring out how to create a macro to suspend the script, feel free to send me a solution and I'll put it here.
